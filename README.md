# MacqD-A-Deep-Learning-based-Model-for-Automatic-Detection-of-Socially-housed-Laboratory-Macaques
MacqD is a modified Mask R-CNN model that incorporates a SWIN transformer backbone for enhanced attention-based feature extraction. It robustly detects macaques in their home-cage under challenging scenarios, including occlusions, glass reflections, and overexposure to light.
